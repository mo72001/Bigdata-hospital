In this project, we developed models to predict whether a patient's hospital charges would be high (greater than 20,000). 
The goal was to assist hospitals in identifying high-cost patients to help plan resources effectively. 
We used both machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models to achieve this prediction.

Key Insights and Findings:
Dataset: 
The dataset contained key features related to patient demographics, admission type, and charges. 
The target variable, HighCharges, was created by categorizing the Charges column as high (1) or low (0).

Data Exploration:

Visualizations such as histograms, boxplots, and correlation heatmaps helped us understand the distribution of charges and how different features relate to one another.

We cleaned the data by addressing missing values, handling outliers, and removing duplicates, ensuring high-quality data for model training.

Preprocessing:

We created the HighCharges target variable and performed feature scaling using StandardScaler to ensure the numerical features were on the same scale for optimal model performance.

Categorical variables were encoded using StringIndexer to make them suitable for model input.

Model Development:

We evaluated three machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree, as well as a deep learning model using a neural network with dense layers and dropout for regularization.

Evaluation Metrics:

We used AUC (Area Under the Curve) to measure how well the models discriminated between high and low charges.

Other performance metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score were also evaluated to understand the balance between correctly predicting high charges and minimizing false positives.

Model Performance:
Random Forest and Logistic Regression performed the best, showing higher AUC scores, indicating that they were effective at distinguishing between high and low charges.

Decision Tree had lower performance, likely due to overfitting, which made it less suitable for this task compared to the other models.

Key Visuals:
Model Comparison (AUC): A bar plot visually compares the AUC scores of the different models, helping us assess which model was the most effective.

Precision-Recall Trade-off: Insights into precision and recall balance revealed the trade-offs between correctly identifying high-charge patients and avoiding false positives.

Conclusion:
This project demonstrates that Random Forest and Logistic Regression are suitable models for predicting high hospital charges, offering hospitals a way to effectively allocate resources and manage financial risks. 
The deep learning model could be further optimized, but the simpler models showed excellent performance.
